## About

NerFW *(Nergans FrameWork)* is a framework for visual novel creation. This framework
is created in an attempt to make creation of visual novels more convenient for game developers,
and at the same time to make the game harder to pirate. 

NerFW is based on Flask. And is creating a server which hosts the game for you.
